      <p>
        Dudhsagar Decorators & Sound began its journey over
        <strong>20 years ago</strong>, rooted deeply in Goan traditions and
        family values.
      </p>

      <p>
        The business was first started by the <strong>owner’s father</strong>,
        who laid the foundation with dedication, sincerity, and a strong
        commitment to quality service. What started as a small local setup
        gradually grew through word of mouth and customer trust.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, the responsibility is proudly carried forward by
        <strong>Girish Gawas</strong>, who continues the legacy while expanding
        services to meet modern event needs. Under his leadership, the team has
        successfully completed <strong>200+ decoration setups and sound
        rentals</strong> across Goa.
      </p>

      <p>
        From traditional maatov ceremonies to family functions and community
        events, every setup is handled with care, respect, and attention to
        detail.
